  | Requests | It allows to send HTTP/1.1 requests easily without manually handling query strings, headers, or form data. |
  | OS | It allows a Python program to interact with the underlying operating system, making it possible to perform tasks such as file and directory management, process handling, environment variable access, and path manipulations. |
  | MURF | Murf AI is used to generate realistic voice output from text input.|
  | api_key | Integrating Murf AI’s API, the program converts written content into lifelike speech. |
